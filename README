INSTALLATION
	See also : DEPENDENCIES below

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file 
and type the following:
	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install the W3C libraries somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.
	make

You can then test the module by typing:
	make test

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then install
by typing:
	make install
It will install the library in the perl tree.

RUNNING THE SCRIPT

Along with the library you should have received a simple script and configuration file
that allows you to easily use the library.

From the directory where this README is:
	( cd perl/modules/W3C/LogValidator )
	cd bin/

Edit the configuration file, using the sample as a basis:
	cp samples/logprocess.conf path/to/file.conf
The sample conf is commented with notes and pointers to help you understand 
the syntax of this file. It should be easy to create a config file for your server.
	$EDITOR path/to/file.conf

Make the script executable:
	chmod a+x process.pl

Learn the options:
	./logprocess.pl -h

Then simply run the script with your favorite options, e.g:
	./logprocess.pl -f path/to/file.conf [options]
